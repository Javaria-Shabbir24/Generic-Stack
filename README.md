# Java Generic Stack Implementation

This Java program implements a generic stack data structure. It allows pushing and popping elements of any data type, checking for emptiness, getting the size, and displaying the stack contents. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface for interaction.




## Functionalities

- Supports generic data types for elements in the stack.
- Offers functionalities for pushing, popping, checking emptiness, getting size, and displaying the stack.
- Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Handles invalid user input exceptions like non-integer stack size or invalid push values.

## User Interaction

The program displays a menu offering options to:

- Push an element onto the stack.
- Pop an element from the stack.
- Check if the stack is empty.
- Get the size of the stack.
- Display the contents of the stack.
- Exit the program.
## Input

The program prompts you for input based on the chosen option:

When creating the stack, enter the desired size (integer).
When pushing an element, enter the value based on the generic data type (integer, string, float, etc.).
Invalid input will result in an error message.
## Output

The program displays the chosen menu, user input confirmation messages, and the requested information (operation result, stack size, or stack contents).
